controlled-reduction (version 1.0):

    An implementation of the controlled reduction method for computing the
    Hasse-Weil zeta functions of smooth projective hypersurfaces over finite
    fields. Explicitly, by computing a p-adic approximation of Frobenius
    action on p-adic cohomology (Monsky-Washnizter) with sufficient precision
    and then lifting its characteristic polynomial to the integers.
    An overview of the method can be found in: 
     - "Computing zeta functions of nondegenerate projective hypersurfaces over 
    finite fields", (under preparation) by Edgar Costa and David Harvey.
     - "Effective computations of Hasse-Weil zeta functions", by Edgar Costa
