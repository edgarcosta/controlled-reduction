controlled-reduction (version 1.0):

   A program for computing the Hasse-Weil zeta functions of smooth
   hypersurfaces over finite fields, by computing an approximation of Frobenius
   action on p-adic cohomology (Monsky-Washnizter) with sufficient precision
   and lifting its characteristic polynomial to ZZ[x].
   An overview of the methods can be found in: 
    - "Computing zeta functions of nondegenerate projective hypersurfaces over 
    finite fields", (under preparation) by Edgar Costa and David Harvey.
    - "Effective computations of Hasse-Weil zeta functions", by Edgar Costa
