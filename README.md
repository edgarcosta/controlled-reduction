A program for computing the Hasse-Weil zeta functions of smooth
hypersurfaces over finite fields, by computing an approximation of Frobenius
action on p-adic cohomology (Monsky-Washnizter) with sufficient precision
and lifting its characteristic polynomial to ZZ[x].
An overview of the methods can be found in:

- "Computing zeta functions of nondegenerate projective hypersurfaces over 
finite fields", (under preparation) by Edgar Costa and David Harvey.

- "Effective computations of Hasse-Weil zeta functions", by Edgar Costa
