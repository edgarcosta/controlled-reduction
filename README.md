# controlled-reduction

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/edgarcosta/controlled-reduction.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/edgarcosta/controlled-reduction)

An implementation of the controlled reduction method for computing the
Hasse-Weil zeta functions of smooth projective hypersurfaces over finite
fields. Explicitly, by computing a p-adic approximation of Frobenius
action on p-adic cohomology (Monsky-Washnizter) with sufficient precision
and then lifting its characteristic polynomial to the integers.
An overview of the method can be found in: 
 - "Computing zeta functions of nondegenerate projective hypersurfaces over 
finite fields", (under preparation) by Edgar Costa and David Harvey.
 - "Effective computations of Hasse-Weil zeta functions", by Edgar Costa
