# Bugs:
- frob_J_ZZ_p fails for p = 3 in the factorials
 this should be fixed by only having one version and the loop switches between ZZ and ZZ_p

# Fix code style in:
- dr_nd/dr_nd.cc
- hypersurface/hypersurface.cc
- hypersurface_nd/hypersurface_nd.cc

# Add some examples as tests for:
- hypersurface_nd/hypersurface_nd.cc

# Add code covereage?
 - throuch gcov
